## The Odin Project - Rock Paper Scissors

This is the README file for a Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using JavaScript.

### Project Description

This project involved creating a functional Rock-Paper-Scissors game where users play against the computer.

### Learning Objectives

By building this game, I focused on:

* **JavaScript Fundamentals:** Grasping core concepts like functions, variables, conditional statements, and loops.
* **Game Logic Implementation:** Translating game rules into JavaScript code for determining the winner based on user and computer choices.
